<h2>Structure</h2>

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled 
brackets - these are called HTML <b>elements</b>. Elements are usually 
made up of two <b>tags</b> -  an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML elements tells the browser 
something about how the information that sits between the opening and
closing tags.

<h2>Attributes</h2>

Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of an element and are
made up of two parts: a <b>name</b> and a <b>value</b>,
separated by an equals sign.

```html
<p lang="en-us"> Paragraph in English</p>
```

Here an attribute called lang is
used to indicate the language
used in this element. The value
of this attribute on this page 
specifies it is in US English.

The value of the lang attribute
is an abbreviated way of 
specifying which language is 
used inside of the elements that 
all browsers understand.
